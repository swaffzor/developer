	      To Okeechobee. Checked depth of muck. Talked to homeowner at new staging area to let them know we were mobilizing. Discussed billing with amy and went over days worked and length. Talked with Mohawk about supplying a sealed dump truck. They wanted 80 per hr but finally got them to 65 per hour which is the line item price Henry set. Went over cost sheet and items we will use and we should be able to draw 10 to 11 thousand per day. Picked up checks from Beau and delivered to Raul. He said he was working sat, and will finish. <br><br>to leigh's job, delivered checks. He was moving sand conveyors were seer up nice and he was spreading it with the bobcat. <br><br>to Bonita Bay. Shorty, Jorge, Heber, Jose and Dayles, Mario and Bobby were doing an awesome job when i arrived.
