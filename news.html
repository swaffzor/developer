			This page has been optimized and now works perfectly fine in Safari for iPhone. No more delays or freezing. <br>
			Also, to speed up the recap process, your names are preselected in a drop-down box, and when selected, will autocomplete your email for you. No more typing your name or email.

			<h4>August 27 2014</h4>
			<p align="left">A new Sub-Contractor section has been added to the recap under the check box "Sub Hours". All of the registered subs will be in the drop down under this section and have been removed out of the "Crew Hours" lists. The managing members have requested that you fill out the hours for all subs on your job as you would for TSI employees. If there are subs or employees on your job that are not on the list, please list their name and hours in the summary box.</p>
			<h4>July 25 2014</h4>
			<p align="left">To eliminate the possibility of duplicate employee entries, there has been some changes to how the employee name drop downs behave. If an employee has already been submitted by another supervisor, their name will be <span style="color: gray;">grayed out and unable to select</span> (a.k.a. disabled.) <br>So don't panic when you can't enter hours for some people, that just means somebody already entered hours for that employee.</p>
			<h4>July 18 2014</h4>
			<p align="left">There has been some work done to increase the speed of the "freezing" issue on mobile safari. The issue is because of a bug in mobile safari. If you were to use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chrome-web-browser-by-google/id535886823?mt=8">chrome mobile browser</a>, there wont be any delay at all.</p>
